# Chrome T-Rex
- My implementation of the no internet game. Done with canvas & vanilla js.
- You can acces the real one typing <b><u>chrome://dino</u></b> in chrome as a URL
- Since <b><u>keypress</u></b> in JavaScript is deprecated, we are using <b><u>ArrowDown</u></b> for crouching and <b><u>ArrowUp</u></b> to run normal again, so we are changing the behaviour of the real game a little bit cos of this.
- Right now, Pteras appear when the score is 1500 and gets faster at 2500.
- The speed of the game (obstacles and map) gets faster at 600 and 2500.
